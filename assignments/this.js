/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding, the default binding for this, where this refers to the Window Object. Can be overridden with "use strict"
* 2. Implicit Binding, when JavaScript determines where this points, to know look to the left of the dot in the function call, thisObject.function()
* 3. Explicit Binding, when You determine where this points, the function containing this is standalone, and must be couple with .call(), .apply(), or .bind() to know what this is.
* 4. New Binding, allows you to use an obect template to create new instances of an object which is used as this for the method being called.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
